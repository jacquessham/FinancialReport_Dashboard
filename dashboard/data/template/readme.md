# Plug-in Templates
Coming soon...

## Instructions
The general workflows of creating a plug-in that is integratable to the dashboarding scripts are:
<ol>
	<li>Create a folder, name it with the ticker of the company in lower cases</li>
	<li>Within the folder, create another folder named <i>dataset</i> in lower cases</li>
	<li>Create two scripts to handle income statement data and chart. More details are coming soon...</li>
	<li>Create two scripts to handle balance sheet data and chart. More details are coming soon...</li>
	<li>Create two scripts to handle cashflow statement data and chart. More details are coming soon...</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
When writing scripts on preparing data for charting, the rule of thumb is to ingest lower granularity data (Node numbers are either in the beginning or at the end). More details are coming soon...
