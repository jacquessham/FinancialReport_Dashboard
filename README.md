# Financial Report Dashboard
Inspired from the sankey chart found in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/10ur1ya/oc_how_google_makes_money_its_2022_income/">post</a> on Reddit, the goal is to develop a dashboard to display similar visualization for other companies on income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.


## Proof of Concept
The first step is to replicate the sankey chart found in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/10ur1ya/oc_how_google_makes_money_its_2022_income/">post</a> to look at the visualization rendered by Plotly and Python before building the framework of the Dashboard. You may find more details in the [Proof of Concept](/poc) folder.

## The Plan
Coming soon...
